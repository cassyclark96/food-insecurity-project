## Objective

[The Bok Choy Project](https://change-today.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/The-Bok-Choy-Project-Shauntrice-Martin-1.pdf) started by Shauntrice Rice, Root Cause Research Center, and Nichole Funk here in Louisville, KY highlights the impact that food insecurity has on the local community and who is affected by it most in Louisville. To example this, The Bok Choy Project went around town to various Krogers and documented the amount of and quality of produce offered at the different Krogers. In low-income communities and communities that are majority BIPOC, the Kroger had a ton of empty shelves, limited tropical produce, and no bok choy (hence, the name of the project). The Bok Choy project, the fact that [13.7 million households](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-us/key-statistics-graphics.aspx) experienced food insecurity in 2019, and about [$161 billion worth of food](https://www.rts.com/resources/guides/food-waste-america/) is wasted each year inspired me to try and build a model that would predict food insecurity so that policy makers, federal and local government officals, ect, can all be proactive in the fight to end food insecurity. No one should go hungry no matter their income, job status, disability status, or what have you considering the amount of food thrown out each year.

## Data 

For this project I used the [Food Security Data for 2019](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/cps/cps-supp_cps-repwgt/cps-food-security.html) from the Census Current Population Survey Food Security file. A detailed data dictionary for the original data set can be found [here](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/techdocs/cpsdec19.pdf).
