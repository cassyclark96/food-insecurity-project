## Objective
The purpose of this project is to be able to predict when and where food insecurity will occur to help push for change that will allow affordable, easily accessible healthy options for all. The inspiration for this project started after learning about the [Bok Choy Project](https://change-today.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/The-Bok-Choy-Project-Shauntrice-Martin-1.pdf) started by Shauntrice Rice, Root Cause Research Center, and Nichole Funk here in Louisville, KY highlighting the impacts that food insecurity has on the local community and who is affected by it most, specifically in Louisville.
